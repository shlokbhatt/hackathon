# You are to prompt the user to enter a number, and read it in.
# Assume that the user will input a valid positive integer.
# (Hint: Read the input in as a string, since some of these
# numbers can be too big to store as integer variables).

# Output a message saying whether the input number is
# pandigital. If it is not, print out all missing
# digits in order from least to greatest.
